1) The Raw Data
   - Please find supplied dataset in course's assignment page or at:
     http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
     
     Composed of 24 data files, separated by spaces.
     Each file has, per row, a vriable amount of measurements for 
     a single variable, for a single subject, for a single activity.
     Variables are: 
        X (the time and frequency domain variables, in about 561 measurements), 
        Subject (the id of the 30 different people used for experiment),
        Y (the id for the activity performed),
        body_acc_x (the estimated body acceleration in the x direction),
        body_acc_y (the estimated body acceleration in the y direction),
        body_acc_z (the estimated body acceleration in the z direction),
        body_gyro_x (the angle in the x direction),
        body_gyro_y (the angle in the y direction),
        body_gyro_z (the angle in the z direction),
        total_acc_x (the measured acceleration in the x direction),
        total_acc_y (the measured acceleration in the y direction),
        total_acc_z (the measured acceleration in the z direction).

2) The Tidy Dataset
   - Please find tidy dataset in this github folder as:
     ds.csv      - the integrated dataset of means and standard deviations for each 
                   measured variable, with one row per experiment.
     ds.summ.csv - the summarized dataset with average means and average standard 
                   deviations for each variable, with one row per subject, per activity.

3) Codebook describing every variable
   - The variables found in ds.csv are:
       "subject"          - Numeric ID for the person performing the activity
       "y"                - Text description of the Activity carried out by subject 
                            one of: "WALKING" "WALKING_UPSTAIRS" "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS" 
                            "SITTING" "STANDING" "LAYING"
       "x.mean"           - mean for time and frequency domain measurements
       "x.sd"             - standard deviation for time and frequency domain measutements
       "body_acc_x.mean"  - mean for estimated body acceleration in x 
       "body_acc_x.sd"    - standard deviation for estimated body acceleration in x
       "body_acc_y.mean"  - mean for estimated body acceleration in y
       "body_acc_y.sd"    - standard deviation for estimated body acceleration in y
       "body_acc_z.mean"  - mean for estimated body acceleration in z
       "body_acc_z.sd"    - standard deviation for estimated body acceleration in z
       "body_gyro_x.mean" - mean for x angle 
       "body_gyro_x.sd"   - standard deviation for x angle 
       "body_gyro_y.mean" - mean for y angle
       "body_gyro_y.sd"   - standard deviation for y angle
       "body_gyro_z.mean" - mean for z angle
       "body_gyro_z.sd"   - standard deviation for z angle
       "total_acc_x.mean" - mean for measured acceleration in x
       "total_acc_x.sd"   - standard deviation for measured acceleration in x
       "total_acc_y.mean" - mean for measured acceleration in y
       "total_acc_y.sd"   - standard deviation for measured acceleration in y
       "total_acc_z.mean" - mean for measured acceleration in z
       "total_acc_z.sd"   - standard deviation for measured acceleration in z

4) Process to obtain the tidy dataset
   - The data was read from the raw text files, one variable at a time, onto data frames 
     with many columns for all the measurements that were supplied.
   - These data frames were summarized taking the mean and the standard deviation for each
     row, ignoring NA values.
   - The resulting variables were named after the original variable, adding .mean and .sd 
     as indicators for the mean and the standard deviation.
